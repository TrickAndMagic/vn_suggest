The locals there have adapted to this peculiar phenomenon, and carry on with their lives as if the rain was never there. No one takes an umbrella, no one wears a rain coat.\n\nThe main character of the story is 17 year old Chris, a Fortelle student of the famous Piova Communal School of Music (Scuola Comunale di Musica Piova, in Italian). Separated from his childhood sweetheart Arietta when he left his home town for the city, he keeps in touch with her through the means of weekly letters. Penning their thoughts on those letters, Chris treasures and keeps her weekly writings, for he had promised her that should his drawer become totally filled with them, he would return to her.\n\nThe game starts during Chris's third year as a student, a few months before he has to take the school's final graduation examination: a staged performance. As an instrumentalist, he is required to search for a vocalist partner before he is eligible for the examination.","aliases":null,"image":"https://s.vndb.org/cv/24/5024.jpg","links":{"wikipedia":"Symphonic_Rain","encubed":"symphonic-rain","renai":null},"length":3,"votecount":1061,"popularity":20.08,"release":{"freeware":true,"patch":true,"original":null,"type":"complete","id":762,"producers":[{"name":"TLWiki","publisher":true,"id":925,"developer":false,"original":null,"type":"ng"}],"title":"Symphonic

The main character, Keiichi Maebara, moves to Hinamizawa and befriends his new classmates Rena Ryugu, Mion Sonozaki, Rika Furude, and Satoko Hojo. Keiichi joins their after-school club activities, which consist mostly of card and board games (and punishment games for the loser, usually him.) Hinamizawa appears to be a normal, peaceful, rural village to Keiichi. However, the tranquility abruptly ends after the annual Watanagashi Festival, a celebration to commemorate and give thanks to the local god, Oyashiro-sama. Keiichi learns that every year for the past four years, one person has been murdered and another has gone missing on the day of the Watanagashi Festival. Keiichi himself soon becomes drawn into the strange events surrounding the Watanagashi Festival and Oyashiro-sama. In each story arc, he or one of his friends become paranoid, and a crime is committed. Usually, the crime involves the murder of one of their own friends. While it seems impossible to tell their delusions apart from the mystery of Hinamizawa, slowly the truth is revealed.","original":"ひぐらしのなく頃に","rating":"all ages","id":67,"orig_lang":["ja"],"platforms":["win","lin","mac","ios","and","gba","nds","ps2","ps3","psv","oth"],"tags":[{"score":3,"name":"Ambient Sounds","cat":"tech","id":1856,"spoiler":false},{"score":3,"name":"Friendship","cat":"cont","id":710,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.95,"name":"NVL","cat":"tech","id":43,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.94,"name":"Murder Mystery","cat":"cont","id":153,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.93,"name":"Group of Friends","cat":"cont","id":811,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.93,"name":"Thriller","cat":"cont","id":789,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.92,"name":"Denpa","cat":"cont","id":960,"spoiler":true},{"score":2.9,"name":"Alternate Dimensions","cat":"cont","id":250,"spoiler":true},{"score":2.88,"name":"Episodic Story","cat":"tech","id":598,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.85,"name":"Time Loop","cat":"cont","id":349,"spoiler":true},{"score":2.82,"name":"Summer","cat":"cont","id":760,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.78,"name":"Madness","cat":"cont","id":288,"spoiler":true},{"score":2.75,"name":"Photographic Backgrounds","cat":"tech","id":433,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.74,"name":"Violence","cat":"cont","id":157,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.71,"name":"No Sexual Content","cat":"tech","id":235,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.64,"name":"Mystery","cat":"cont","id":19,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.64,"name":"80's","cat":"cont","id":741,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.57,"name":"Detective Work","cat":"cont","id":323,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.57,"name":"Horror","cat":"cont","id":7,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.55,"name":"Fear of Death","cat":"cont","id":8,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.53,"name":"No Event CGs","cat":"tech","id":795,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.5,"name":"Child Abuse","cat":"cont","id":164,"spoiler":true},{"score":2.5,"name":"Traditionalist Family","cat":"cont","id":218,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.44,"name":"Festival","cat":"cont","id":537,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.44,"name":"Twins as Support Characters","cat":"cont","id":409,"spoiler":true},{"score":2.4,"name":"Paranoia","cat":"cont","id":1789,"spoiler":true},{"score":2.39,"name":"Unreliable Narrator","cat":"tech","id":779,"spoiler":true},{"score":2.39,"name":"School","cat":"cont","id":47,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.31,"name":"Shinto Shrine","cat":"cont","id":319,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.25,"name":"Varied Title Screens","cat":"tech","id":1646,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.25,"name":"Shouwa Era","cat":"cont","id":1967,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.2,"name":"Food Discussions","cat":"cont","id":599,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.17,"name":"Epidemic","cat":"cont","id":1852,"spoiler":true},{"score":2.17,"name":"Biological Weapon","cat":"cont","id":1851,"spoiler":true},{"score":2.14,"name":"Fictional Modern Day Japanese Countryside","cat":"cont","id":550,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.13,"name":"Asian-style Manor","cat":"cont","id":310,"spoiler":false},{"score":2.1,"name":"Japanese Mythology","cat":"cont","id":1011,"spoiler":false},{"score":2,"name":"Corporations","cat":"cont","id":45,"spoiler":true},{"score":2,"name":"No Romance Plot","cat":"tech","id":2223,"spoiler":false},{"score":1.93,"name":"Past","cat":"cont","id":141,"spoiler":false},{"score":1.76,"name":"Temple","cat":"cont","id":317,"spoiler":false},{"score":1.58,"name":"Yakuza","cat":"cont","id":217,"spoiler":true},{"score":1.5,"name":"Naked Sprites","cat":"tech","id":1446,"spoiler":true},{"score":1.12,"name":"Slice of Life Comedy","cat":"cont","id":142,"spoiler":false},{"score":1,"name":"Torture Chamber","cat":"cont","id":2064,"spoiler":true},{"score":0.78,"name":"Mahjong as Story Element","cat":"cont","id":1290,"spoiler":false}],"languages":["en","fr","ja","ru","zh"],"starter_friendly":true,"release":{"id":37233,"doujin":false,"released":"2015-05-15","languages":["en","ja"],"title":"Higurashi When They Cry Hou -

face of human technological advancement during the Meiji Restoration, the youkai of Japan were forced to make a hard decision:\n1) To remain as youkai and watch over the land\n2) To return to the netherworld\n3) To give up their power and status as youkai and live amongst humans.\n\nWhile there were some that chose otherwise, the majority of the youkai decided it was best to become human. It was tough, but as time passed these youkai were able to blend in with the human world and live peacefully amongst them.\n\nHowever, blood is thicker than water. The offspring of these youkai displayed the powerful abilities of their ancestors in times of great anxiety, often manifesting in horrible and dangerous ways, and were labeled by society as monsters. \nOfficially their condition was named \"Acquired Systemic Special Heredity variety Syndrome\", or \"ASSHS\" for short and treated as a non-contagious illness, but the common people began to refer to them as Jinyous (half-youkai) nevertheless. \n\nOf these Jinyous, most were sent to Kamizawa City: an isolated urban area walled off from the rest of Japan to keep all the Jinyous together and away from the human population. However, the ones that were deemed especially dangerous were sent to a medical facility on an uncharted island near the shores of Japan where they would be under constant surveillance.\n\nTakabe Ryouichi was one of those who were sent to said island at the age of five. This is a story about him along with the girl called Suzu, his only friend on the island, escaping to Kamizawa city to live a normal life. What they didn’t expect was that Suzu carried a secret that attracted much unwanted attention…","image":"https://s.vndb.org/cv/60/8760.jpg","aliases":null,"links":{"wikipedia":null,"encubed":"ayakashibito","renai":null},"length":4,"popularity":11.45,"votecount":546,"release":{"released":"2014-04-01","languages":["en"],"title":"Ayakashibito","doujin":false,"producers":[{"name":"Ate

While set in a modern setting, the city also gives off a strange sense of nostalgia. \n\nTennouji Kotarou lives here. He's a high school student who has the ability to rewrite his own body; he can become stronger and faster at any time he chooses. He investigates supernatural mysteries with five girls from his school.\n\nThe basis of the story is set in a high school setting. The first half of Rewrite primarily consists of the characters interacting in many everyday, enjoyable scenes. The latter half, however, is more serious, emotional, and carries a sense of mystery to the plot.\n\nAs indicated by the title, rewriting is the theme of the game's scenario.

Devastated in the aftermath of defeat, the Japanese government complies with the Allies' reconstruction plan. Japan begins to recover from the loss after a few years, but America and China intricately divide the nation on a municipal level. Eventually, China's military districts become Chinatowns, and places controlled by the United States are Americanized. The many Chinese and American immigrants make Japanese people the minority in their own land.

Trials last 3 days at most, due to the large number of cases that the courts must deal with; if the accused cannot be found innocent after this time, their case is consigned to a higher court. The majority of the work during a trial is on the shoulders of the defense attorney who must cross-examine the witnesses brought forth by the prosecution to find contradictions in testimony to clear their client.\n\nThe playable character is Phoenix Wright. He is a rookie lawyer fresh out of law school in the first game, taking a position at Fey & Co. Law Offices run by Mia Fey, a defense attorney that helped to acquit Wright of murder several years prior to the events of the first game. When Mia is murdered, Wright takes over the offices with the assistance of Maya Fey, Mia's younger sister, and renames the office \"Wright & Co. Law Offices\". The Fey family have the ability to channel spirits, which sometimes allows Maya to channel Mia's spirit for Wright to help in court.

Ayumu claims to have been sent by his father, an eccentric and possibly delusional man who ordered Ayumu to find and protect Yumina, whom he believes will one day save the universe.\n\nAyumu and Yumina are at odds from the moment they first meet.
